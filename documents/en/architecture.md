## Introduction
The Basolato framework uses an architecture based on domain-driven design. By creating applications based on domain-driven design, it is possible to create highly changeable and bug-resistant applications quickly.

## Usecases
It is also called an application service.  
It receives parameters from the controller, instantiates entities, invokes functions of entities, and passes entities to the repository for persistence, etc.

## Domain model (Aggregates)
